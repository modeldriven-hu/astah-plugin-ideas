# Astah plugin ideas

The following repository contains all the ideas that we came up for Astah, a great modeling tool. If you would
like to implement any of these ideas, feel free to contact me, I am happy to support you.

## Rich text editor [ongoing]

For documenting model elements Astah only provides a text area. In this plugin, when the user select a model element, the
associated documentation would be visible in the rich text editor. When the user deselects a model element, then it the 
editor will be empty and disabled. When user selects multiple elements, the editor will be likewise empty and disabled.
The editor could support basic rich editing capabilities, like:
- bold
- italic
- align (left, right, center, justify)
- color (background, foreground)
- table
- link
- image?
- undo/redo support
- etc.
